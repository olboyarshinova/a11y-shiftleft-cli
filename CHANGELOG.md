# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - Unreleased

Initial public MVP candidate.

### Added

- CLI commands: `init`, `check`, and `ci`.
- Dynamic accessibility scanning with Playwright and axe.
- React static scanning fallback with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`.
- Normalized issue schema for static and dynamic findings.
- Severity triage: `critical`, `warning`, and `info`.
- Deduplication by rule, target, and severity.
- JSON, CSV, and Markdown report outputs.
- Metrics export for `rawCount`, `uniqueCount`, `duplicateCount`,
  `duplicateRate`, `scanDurationMs`, `bySource`, and `bySeverity`.
- GitHub Actions workflow generation.
- Demo React/Vite app with intentional accessibility findings.
- Core, adapter, reporter, and CLI gate tests.

### Known Limitations

- Vue and Angular static adapters are planned but not implemented yet.
- Dynamic scans require the target app to already be running at a reachable URL.
- The CLI does not certify WCAG conformance; automated checks cover only part of
  accessibility review.
- PR comment behavior still needs end-to-end validation in GitHub Actions.
